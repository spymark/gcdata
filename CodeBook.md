*Describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data*

The data in the tidy dataset are combined for both test and train sets of the original source. Subject ids and activity names have been included. The measurements here consist of the average of each of the original source features over subject and activity. 

Apart from the first two features and the last one that we kept for consistency, we have renamed all the others to explain whether they are from the Accelerometer of the Gyroscope (Acc and Gyro respectively in the name). We have also only kept the ones that contain mean or standar deviation measurements. X,Y or Z in the name signify the axis of the measurement.

The feature names in our tidy dataset are the folowing:

"subject",  This is the subject Id 
"activity", This is the actual name of the activity
